# OrderAPI
OrderAPI is a RESTful API that's built with Java / Maven / Spring Boot (version 2.7.4) application that is built for managing orders for customers. 
It provides two functionalities via HTTP GET/POST endpoints: 
  - Getting list of all orders (Content-Type: application/json): HTTP GET - http://localhost:8080/order
  - Creating an order (Content-Type: application/json): HTTP POST - http://localhost:8080/order

OrderAPI uses an in-memory database (H2) to store the data. It can be accessed via its own console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console (username: sa, password: password)
